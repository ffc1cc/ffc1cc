    <p>To live in the aftermath of trauma is to live out of place and out of time, floating in a perpetual past within the present; it is also to live incessantly haunted by memories that refuse to stay buried. How, then, are traumatic events remembered-and represented-by individuals who lived through them and by those who come after them? When the sheer violence of an event shatters any sense of subjectivity and intelligibility, how does one re-member one-self?<br>Moreover, in that the individual always already exists within the social, how are personal re-collections of trauma further complicated by the ultimate social-the nation? When the nation claims the event for its own politics, wrenching, subordinating it from the individual, how does one navigate the haunted terrain between ethical responsibility and self-erasure? How does one mourn and memorialize trauma-to speak the unspeakable?<br>This course will examine the multiple ways in which trauma (arising from catastrophic and/or violent events) is remembered. We will analyze memoirs, novels, films, photographs, and memorials/museums from a variety of cultures to understand the relationship between individual/collective, memory/history, past/present, self/nation so as to address how to make sense of, represent, and pass on a constellation of contesting stories.<br>This course aims for students to: (a)become familiar with key ideas and concepts in memory and trauma studies; (b)develop critical reading and writing skills; (c)present complex ideas in a persuasive and organized manner; and (d)enjoy reading and thinking!</p>
